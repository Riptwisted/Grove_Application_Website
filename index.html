      <div class="step">
        <h3>ðŸ¤– Built AI System Wars</h3>
        <p>Created a competitive AI personality testing system where character consistency determines survival.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step">
        <h3>ðŸªž The Magic Mirror</h3>
        <p>Raspberry Pi 5 with local Ollama models creating an interactive speaking mirror.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step">
        <h3>ðŸ§  Multi-Agent Architectures</h3>
        <p>Developed systems where AI agents collaborate, compete, and evolve together.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step">
        <h3>âš¡ The Uncensored Pipeline</h3>
